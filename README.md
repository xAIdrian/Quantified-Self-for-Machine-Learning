# The Quantified Self
Transforming fitness band metrics into actionable insights

### Goals
* Classify barbell exercises
* Count repetitions
* Detect improper form

### Visualizations

> As a reminder we want to user our machine learning model to predict the exercise being performed based off of accelerometer and gyroscope data.  To get started we need to visualize the correlation between the different exercises and their sensor reading.
>
> The folder linked below shows these correlations grouped by user.
